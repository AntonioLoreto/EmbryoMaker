Nomeclature of output_model.dat

NC      -> File not created, this applies for volume, robustness measure or
developmenal_time
LTLD    -> individual was filtrated (something went wrong) during development. This means there was a individual.datfitness created during the development part. 
INVMU   -> after mutation, the file inviable.e was created, which means
mutation was not viable
NOD     -> Development was not runned for whatever reason
NA      -> Individual was not integrated in populatio because fitness was less
that least fit individual at the time.
I also have NA for volume beacuse in proyection fitness function you do not
evaluate volume. This is problematic with reconstruction of ancestry. 

inviable.e means that the mutation either eliminated the gene network (by a deletion on a 1 gene network)
or that none of the genes are transcribable (all are kindof>2)

kindof == -1 means it is a ghost gene

recombination_history.txt nomenclature: 
# [number of recombination]
[number of genes recombined in this event]
[gen number, i] gene(i)%t(:)
[gen number, i] gene(i)%e(:)
[gen number, i] gen(ihc)%diffu  gen(ihc)%mu  gen(ihc)%mich  gen(ihc)%kindof  	

mutacode nomenclature:
0 = no mutation
1 = degradetion rate
2 = diffusion rate
3 = michaelis-menten constant
4 = either a Topology change or IS mutation in matrix T (you can determine one or other looking at the prevalue and newvalue, if 0 and diff 0 or diff 0 and 0 then it was a Topology change)
5 = ceither a Topology change or IS mutation in matrix E (you can determine one or other looking at the prevalue and newvalue, if 0 and diff 0 or diff 0 and 0 then it was a Topology change)
!6 = nww matrix			!AL 9-12-24: this is commented. It might bring problems in the future...
!7 =  kadh matrix
7 = deletion,duplication
8 = recombination
